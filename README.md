# MotivationalV3
Version 3 of my code to automatically crop and apply motivational text to images; this time in python.

## Installation
1.  Download this repository to a folder on your computer
2.  Make sure you have python3 installed on your machine
3.  It is good to have terminal access to your computer, so make sure you have a program like mobaXterm (for windows) and Terminal for mac
4.  you will need to install a couple libraries using pip using the following commands:
*  `pip3 install Pillow`
*  `pip3 install smartcrop`
5.  If you have a windows machine, you may have to rename the `run.command` file to `run.bat`
6.  if you are running into issues with permissions with the run.command file, open terminal and run the following command: `chmod u+x /path-to-file/run.command`
